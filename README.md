**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

> I use data gathered from interviews and research to understand the need of the user. I use user stories to help put into words the goals of the user. Using this data and the user stories, I can put myself in the shoes of the user and design a product that they are more likely to engage with and enjoy.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

> I approach development from an agile mindset. I like to break up development into a bunch of bite sized pieces, and then I estimate the time required for each piece and its priority. This process aids in picking what can be delivered during each sprint. I hope to use the Scrum framework, or one of its offshoots, in my future development work.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

> A good team member takes ownership of their work, aids their fellow team members, is forthcoming about any issues that may arise during development, and understand the vision for the product that the team is working on.
